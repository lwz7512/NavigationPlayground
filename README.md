react-navigation playground without expo
--------------------

a react-navigation demos migrated from [Navigation Playground Example](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/master/examples/NavigationPlayground)


The Example didn't run successfully here in my environment, may be because of Expo service blocked in China. So, I created this repository and made a little modification to run finally.

### Usage

first, clone this repository then cd the root directory, then:

```
$ npm i
$ react-native link
$ react-native run-ios
```

Enjoy it!
